<p>"Greetings, friends! Ready to paint the town red with laughter and merriment? With my rainbow-colored wig and a nose
	 that lights up the night, I'm the clown who's always ready to put on a show. But lately, there's been a strange vibe in the
	  air, a feeling that something isn't quite right. The other day, while I was practicing my juggling routine, 
	  I could've sworn I heard footsteps behind me, but when I turned around, there was nobody there. It's like we're being watched, 
	  but by whom or what, I can't say. All I know is that there's a shadow looming over our circus, and it's getting harder and 
	  harder to ignore."</p>
