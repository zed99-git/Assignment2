<p>Hello, everyone. I'm a gentle giant with a heart of gold. Despite my towering stature, 
	I've always been more comfortable with a paintbrush than a spotlight. But lately, even I can't escape the sense of 
	foreboding that hangs over our troupe like a dark cloud. The other clowns whisper in hushed tones about a mysterious 
	figure that roams the grounds at night, its presence sending shivers down their spines. I've tried to reassure them that 
	it's just their imagination running wild, but deep down, I can't shake the feeling that there's something lurking in the 
	shadows, waiting to reveal itself when we least expect it.</p>
