What is an ARG? 
Augmented Reality Game (ARG) is a type of interactive, immersive experience that combines elements of the real world with computer-generated information and graphics. ARGs typically use the physical environment as a platform and employ various media, including GPS, video, audio, and other sensory inputs, to provide an engaging and interactive experience.
ARGs blur the line between the real world and a fictional or augmented layer. They often use the player's real-world surroundings as the backdrop for the game. Typically involving a compelling storyline or narrative that unfolds progressively. Players become participants in the story, often working collaboratively to solve puzzles, uncover mysteries, or achieve specific objectives.
