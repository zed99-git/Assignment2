<p>Hello, fellow circus dwellers! Zephyr here, the aerial acrobat of the troupe. My graceful movements and daring stunts 
	never fail to captivate the audience. But amidst the glitter and applause, there is a figure that haunts the edges of our 
	world. His presence is like a chill wind that rustles through the tent, sending shivers down my spine. What secrets does he hold, 
	hidden beneath that mysterious facade? I cannot help but feel a sense of foreboding whenever he draws near, as if his very presence
	 heralds impending doom.</p>
